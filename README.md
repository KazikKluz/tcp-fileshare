## The challenge

Build a client and a server to transfer files over TCP.
Extra points if you add a layer of encryption on top of that and if you can
transfer multiple files at once. Once you have your implementation ready,
give the client code and your IP address to a friend or a colleague, then ask
them to send you some files! Hint: You could use mux/demux to receive
multiple files at once.
